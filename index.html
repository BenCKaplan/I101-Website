    <h3> Website Introduction </h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! My name is Ben Kaplan and I will be using this website in order
      to keep track of the assignments I have completed for INFO-I101.  I will continue to
      put the global links to my assignments and projects on this page so that
      they are able to be viewed by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want this page to be consistently used, so I made it a little personal,
      as I added some of my favorite pictures above. The left-most picture is of my friends and I
      having a cookout, with the picture next to it being two of my dogs, Grace
      and Hank.

      <div class = "bioText">
        I am in my third year at Indiana University studying computer science
        with a specialization in security with Spanish as my minor. I was born
        in Atlanta, Georgia and have lived there for my entire life while I'm
        not in Bloomington. Something that motivates me the most is the opinion
        of my brother. He has pushed me my entire life to do well, and I would
        say one of my biggest personal goals is to live up to those standards.
        I am not completely sure what type of job I would like to have in the
        future, however I know for a fact that I would like to be able to
        interact with co-workers and clientele in person on a daily basis.

    <h3> Bucket List </h3>
    <p>
      Before I graduate, my number one professional/academic bucket list item is to find an internship
      for next summer. For a personal or fun bucket list item, I think my main bucket
      list item is to go to Little 500, as I only went for about twenty minutes during
      my first year, and wasn't able to go this year or last because of COVID-19.

        <i> C212 Final Project:</i> Movie Booking System<br><br>
        <i> Description: </i> As the sole group member, my goal was to design
        a system which is similar to a movie reservation booking app, where a
        customer is able to buy movie tickets specified by title, genre, or release
        date. Another part of the assignment was to provide admin controls, where
        a movie theatre worker would be able to add, remove, and edit movie listings.
