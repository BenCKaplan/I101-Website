# I101-Website
Code used to create a website.

https://bckaplan.pages.iu.edu/index.html

As a part of my grade in an informatics class, we were instructed to create and maintain a website which showcased our work throughout the semester.  On the website are links to various assignments I had completed, links to my social media platforms, a downloadable pdf version of my resume, and a brief biography about myself.

The website was created using HTML and CSS, which are available to be viewed in this repository.
